# Product Definition: Brewery Explorer

## 1. Vision & Goal
The primary goal of Brewery Explorer is to build an engaging tool for users to discover, locate, and learn about breweries. It will allow users to search for breweries, visualize their locations on an interactive map, and explore statistics related to them.

## 2. Target Audience
The application is designed for two main user groups:
- **Craft Beer Enthusiasts:** People who are passionate about beer and curious to discover new and local breweries.
- **Academic Review:** The professor who will be grading this as a university project.

## 3. Core Features
To achieve its goal, the application will implement the following core features:
- **Interactive Map:** A map view will be provided to visually display the geographical locations of breweries.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Users will be able to search and filter the list of breweries based on various criteria, such as by city or by brewery type (e.g., micro, regional).
- **Statistical Visualizations:** The application will present data-driven insights through charts, such as a breakdown of brewery types by state.

## 4. Design & User Experience
The desired user experience is "Fun & Curious". This will be achieved with a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing interface using a theme like "cupcake" or "retro" from the daisyUI component library.
